# Changelog

## 1.9.0-beta.1 — staging beta

- Labels the owned-catalog release as a staging beta in both manifests; the endpoint, version and label are declared in `release/channels.json` and enforced in CI.
- Installed package: removes committed Python bytecode caches and replaces links that pointed outside the plugin directory with repository URLs marked repository-only.
- Adds an installed `README.md` covering components, requirements, data flow, costs, support and policy links.
- No workflow guidance or MCP endpoint changes; the endpoint is still ForgeGUI staging.

## 1.8.0

- Publishing-connections guidance (#38). Pointed at ForgeGUI staging without a beta label.
